Please **feel free** to fork this repository and make your own games, and then submit a Pull request and if I want to then i will add your game to a folder of community made games!

**Please note that as of right now, I am still developing more games and in the future I hope to make a launcher that you run. This simplifies your experience as you only have to run one file to select which game you want to play, and once you finished with the game it takes you straight back to the launcher**
